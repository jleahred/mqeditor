This component is developed in C++/Qt. It's based on the great QPlainTextEdit and Qt

It's extensible, mainly in C++

## Features:

I will use this component for qadoc program (available on code.google) and hpui (an editor for "humber parser" on maiquel-toolkit-cpp).

I could also use this component to write small editors for Erlang, Go, Sphinx...
